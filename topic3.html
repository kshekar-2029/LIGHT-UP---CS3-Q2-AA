        <p>
            Drivers have a big responsibility. Visibility is low, and one small
            mistake can cause serious harm to people on the road.

            <h2>Tips for Drivers and Riders</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Drive at a safe speed; slow down near houses and schools.</li>
                <li>Use low beam when another vehicle or pedestrian is in front.</li>
                <li>Make sure headlights, brake lights, and signal lights work.</li>
                <li>Do not drive when sleepy or under the influence of alcohol.</li>
                <li>Watch for pedestrians, bicycles, and tricycles at all times.</li>
                <li>Be extra careful in areas without streetlights or with sharp curves.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sharing the Road with Pedestrians</h2>
            <p>
                Remember that some people have to walk because there are no jeepneys
                or tricycles available at night. Give them space and time to cross.
                A little patience can save a life.
