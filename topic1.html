        <h1>Common Nighttime Dangers</h1>
        <p>
            At night, our roads in San Vicente can be risky for both drivers and pedestrians.
            Streetlights, traffic, and people behave differently after sunset, so we need to be
            more alert than in the daytime.

            <h2>Dangers in the Dark</h2>
            <p>
                Dim or broken streetlights, fast vehicles, and quiet areas make it easier
                for accidents and crimes to happen. People walking home from work or
                school may not be seen by drivers, and criminals can hide in dark corners.
            </p>

            <p>
                In some parts of San Vicente, the road passes rice fields and open lots.
                When there are no houses nearby, there are fewer people who can help
                during an emergency or call the barangay tanod.
            </p>

            <h3>Examples in Local Communities</h3>
            <p>
                These situations can happen in many barangays, especially in places with
                long stretches of road, sharp curves, and few houses.
            </p>

            <h2>Warning Signs of an Unsafe Area</h2>
            <p>
                If you notice these things while travelling at night, it may be safer to
                change your route or ask someone to accompany you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Very few houses or open shops along the road</li>
                <li>Streetlights that are broken, flickering, or missing</li>
                <li>Groups of unknown people standing in the dark for a long time</li>
                <li>Reports of recent snatching or robbery in the area</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                When a place feels unsafe, trust your instinct. Move to a brighter,
                busier area and contact a trusted adult, relative, or neighbor for help.
