        <h1>Safe Walking at Night</h1>
        <p>
            Pedestrians are the most vulnerable on the road. When you walk in San Vicente
            after dark, you share the road with motorcycles, tricycles, and cars. These
            simple habits can greatly reduce your risk.

            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Plan your route and choose streets with working lights.</li>
                <li>Wear light-colored or reflective clothing so drivers can see you.</li>
                <li>Walk on the left side of the road facing oncoming vehicles.</li>
                <li>Cross only at well-lit areas and look left-right-left before crossing.</li>
                <li>Put your phone away while crossing the road.</li>
                <li>Walk with a friend or family member whenever possible.</li>
                <li>Inform someone at home about your expected time of arrival.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>If You Must Walk Alone</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes there are no tricycles or jeepneys available and you are forced
                to walk alone. In that case, stay alert and make yourself harder to target.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay near houses, sari-sari stores, and other places with lights.</li>
                <li>Hold your bag in front of you and keep your phone out of sight.</li>
                <li>Do not wear earphones that block the sound of vehicles behind you.</li>
                <li>Walk with confidence and avoid stopping in dark, quiet spots.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Protecting Yourself from Crime</h2>
            <p>
                Avoid walking near dark alleys, empty lots, or roads with tall grass where
                criminals can hide. If you feel that someone is following you, do not go
                straight home. Instead, walk to a brighter place such as a store, chapel,
                or barangay hall and ask for help.

            <ul>
                <li>Small flashlight or phone with enough battery</li>
                <li>Whistle for calling attention</li>

            <h3>For Parents</h3>
            <p>
                Talk to your children about their daily route. Make sure they know which
                streets are safe and which places to avoid after dark.
