        <p>
            This website was created for a quarterly project in Computer Science to raise awareness
            about nighttime road safety in our community.

            <h2>Focus on San Vicente, Butuan City</h2>
            <p>
                Many residents of San Vicente and nearby barangays walk or ride
                motorcycles along dark roads. Some areas have few houses and weak
                lighting, making them risky for accidents and crime. We wanted to
                collect basic information that can help families travel more safely
                at night.
            </p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Inform students and families about nighttime road dangers.</li>
                <li>Share simple safety tips for walkers and drivers.</li>
                <li>Encourage the community to report broken lights and unsafe areas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We Gathered Information</h2>
            <p>
                Our group discussed our own experiences travelling at night, talked to
                family members, and observed which parts of San Vicente felt safe or
                unsafe. We then organized these ideas into short tips and reminders
                that are easy to understand.
            </p>
